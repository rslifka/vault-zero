## FAQ

### Q: Will there be an Android or iPhone version? You could use Flutter or React Native or...

A: Just to get out ahead of this one üòâ no, sorry. I'm just one person making something first and foremost that I find super useful. I've been quite enjoying Swift, SwiftUI and iOS development; that's enough for me. I realize that narrows down the folks who might find this useful, and that's OK! There's lots of amazing Destiny apps out there üéâ ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Q: What tech did you use?

A: Swift, SwiftUI and CoreData with the phenomenal [AlamoFire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) being used for API interactions. Vault Zero is primarily test-driven using [XCTest](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest) with over 191 tests as of this writing.

### Q: How long did this take?

A: The first commit was August, 2021 - starting without knowledge of app development nor the languages and technologies required.

### Q: Could you open-source it?

A: Maybe!
